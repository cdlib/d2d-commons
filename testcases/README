holdsThisIssue_cases.txt contains the input and date-range output from 201601
    A special version of was used to extract this data. Since the actual requests 
    from 201601 were sent through PIR, the authenication was unilaterally bypassed. 
    The holdings parser was changed to parse the whole enumChron string even if the 
    test date was less than the earliest date in the string. 
    Comments: 
	Open ended ranges get a second date of '-'. E.g., 
            "v.8-(2000/2001-)" 	[2000, -]
        Some strings get no dates. E.g., 
           "v.8-17, 24-25, 29, 31, 33"  
        Some 90 date ranges have the ending date before the starting date. E.g., 
           "1(1972)-17(1928); index: 1-40" [1972, 1928] 
        Some 2622 strings contain '|' and might be better parsed substring by substring. E.g., 
           "(1961)-(1983); v.140(1984)-|Missing: v.177:no.10(2002);v.186:no.2(2007); v.202:no.7(2015);"
           would be really:  "(1961)-(1983); v.140(1984)-" and 
                             "Missing: v.177:no.10(2002);v.186:no.2(2007); v.202:no.7(2015);"
